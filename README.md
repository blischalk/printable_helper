# printable_helper

This is a Clojure attempt at the printable_helper.c program
from Hacking: The Art of Exploitation Second Edition.

The printable_helper.c program takes a starting and ending
memory address. It then determines possible subtractions
that could occur to yield the ending memory address from
the starting memory address using only printable ascii
characters.
